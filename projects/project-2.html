                In IAT201, my team and I were tasked to create a device of our choice. We chose to create
                a portable relaxation device for student youths that helps them relax and increase their productivity.

                I led research on hardware-driven relaxation features and market differentiation, focusing 
                on how physical interactions (buttons, haptics, sound, and form factor) could reduce 
                cognitive load compared to phone-based apps. I analyzed existing mindfulness and productivity 
                devices to identify effective affordances and common pitfalls, then shared clear design 
                principles with the team to guide early decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I translated research insights into concrete UI and interaction ideas, contributing to 
                interface hierarchy, icon-based navigation, and multi-sensory feedback concepts. 
                I collaborated closely with teammates during critiques and iterations, helping align the 
                physical device design with the on-screen experience so interactions felt intuitive, 
                consistent, and purposeful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout iteration, I helped evaluate features such as the pet system, music player, and 
                timer to ensure they supported focus without becoming distracting or manipulative. 
                My contributions helped keep the product grounded in usability and trust, resulting in a 
                cohesive, low-friction design shaped by strong collaboration and shared ownership.
